## Introduction

Programming languages are the foundation of software development. This application aims to provide an easy and interactive way for aspiring developers and enthusiasts to explore various programming languages. With a strat up of choosing in what domain the user wants to learn, and a vast collection of languages to choose from , users can quickly get an overview of each language's key features and then decide to either watch video tutorials or dive deeper into the official documentation.

The application is built using Flutter, a popular UI toolkit for creating natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Dart, the language that Flutter is based on, is also used extensively throughout the application.

## Features

- Explore a wide range of programming languages.
- Read a concise overview of each language's history, key features, and use cases.
- Access curated YouTube video tutorials for hands-on learning.
- Directly navigate to official documentation for in-depth understanding.
- User-friendly interface and smooth navigation.
